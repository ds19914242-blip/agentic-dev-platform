# Architecture Review

## Feature Request

Epic task: Task 006 — Self-registration API and page

## Planner Input

Error: Reached max turns (5)

[WARNING] Claude reached max turns before final response.

## Review Focus

- Does the plan fit existing architecture?
- Which modules are affected?
- Are there unnecessary risky changes?
- Are auth, billing, secrets, DB schema or deployment config affected?

## Affected Areas

- API route: app/api/analyze/route.ts
- API route: app/api/auth/login/route.ts
- API route: app/api/auth/logout/route.ts
- API route: app/api/auth/me/route.ts
- API route: app/api/benchmark/route.ts
- API route: app/api/favorites/[id]/route.ts
- API route: app/api/favorites/route.ts
- API route: app/api/feedback/route.ts
- API route: app/api/health/db/route.ts
- API route: app/api/health/route.ts
- API route: app/api/jobs/[jobId]/route.ts
- API route: app/api/overview/route.ts

## Architecture Recommendation

Reuse existing modules where possible.
Avoid new infrastructure unless explicitly required.
Keep implementation small and reversible.

## Validation Goals

- Confirm the feature works as requested.
- Confirm the implementation follows the plan.
- Confirm architecture risks were addressed.
- Confirm existing flows still work.
- Confirm no unsafe areas were modified.

## Suggested Checks

- Run typecheck.
- Review git diff.
- Manually verify the changed UI/API flow.
- Check error state if API/LLM call fails.
